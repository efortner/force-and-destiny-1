# Fezz, Kubindi
## Location
Fezz is located in the northern hemisphere of Kubindi and is surrounded by misty forests and bogs.

## Description
Fezz is a medium-sized city of several million. As is customary for Kubaz, much of the city is located underground.
City "streets" are made of rough caves about 20 meters in diameter. Speeders are frequently used to traverse the city,
but it is common to see sledges of goods pulled by large sun beetles through the tunnels. Above ground, an sprawling
airport allows for travel to other parts of the planet. The city itself is surrounded by insect farms though these
are largely underground.
