# Jal Shey
## Description
Jal Shey is the adopted homeworld of the nomadic order of the same name (p. 383). The Jal Shey originated within the Je'daii,
but split off and left the chaos of Tython in search of a more stable system to call home. They discovered a system
with a binary star containing a white star and a black hole. The entire system was bathed in the Force much like Tython
but with balance between Dark and Light. The Jal Shey built the planet Jal Shey with an artificial orbit such that
the Light side of the Force is strong during the daytime (when the white sun is visible), and the Dark side is strong at
night (when the black hole is visible). The entire star system has been hidden using the Force.
