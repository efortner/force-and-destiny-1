# Sith Temples

## Description
Sith temples feature multiple waves of enemies of increasing difficulty culminating in a raid boss.

## Altered Rules
* Death in a raid environment is not permanent.
* If all player characters are killed, they are returned to the beginning of the temple with 0 wounds and 0 strain.
* Critical Injuries sustained during the raid are _not_ healed.
* Player earn 5 XP per round regardless of whether they successfully finish the temple.
* On the start of each wave of enemies, all creatures roll initiative based on _either_ Vigilance or Cool.
* After players have defeated all enemies in a wave, they will get one full round before the next wave begins.

## Rewards
On completion players must _immediately_ choose one of the following rewards:
* A powerful Dark Side Force artifact.
* OR, after learning the properties of the artifact, the party may choose to destroy it. Destroying the artifact gives the following benefits:
  * Instant +10 morality to all characters
  * +1 Karma

### Karma
Karma is a resource shared among the party similar to destiny points except that Karma carries between sessions. Karma can be used for one of the following effects (may require GM approval):
* The player characters will soon find a much needed and rare or powerful item of their choice.
* The player characters will immediately end any encounter containing _rival_ or lower tier enemies with a favorable outcome.
* The player characters will gain a powerful ally.
* Other effects postulated by players and approved the GM.
