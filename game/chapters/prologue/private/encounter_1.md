# Encounter 1
## Flavor Text
You arrive outside a dilapidated building in a low rise warehouse district. This is a low traffic part of the city
with very few ships passing overhead and no ground level traffic. You arrive with two Republic gunships, each containing
six [ARC troopers](https://github.com/efortner/force-and-destiny-1/blob/main/game/characters/arc_troopers.md). The
warehouse only appears to have one entrance at ground level. A starship is landed on the roof.

## Location
Outside of a low rise building in a low rise, rundown district. There is a [starship](https://github.com/efortner/force-and-destiny-1/blob/main/game/vessels/norlove_ship.md)
landed on top of the building.

## Events
1. There is a blast door barring entrance. It can be sliced using a nearby terminal (Computers, difficulty 1) if
the PC has a slicing gear. It can also be destroyed (10 wounds, 10 soak).
2. Inside, players will find two groups of 4 *PIRATE CREW* (EotE, p. 393). They are skilled in Ranged (Light) and
carry heavy blaster pistols. Smoke machines produce fog that add 1 setback to all attack rolls; *PIRATE CREW* are
unaffected.

## Loot
There are two storage rooms behind two blast doors (can be sliced or destroyed in the same way as the above door).
* First room: Credit chips totalling 300 credits
* Second room: Credit chips totalling 350 credits
Any player characters that are involved with looting gains 1 conflict.

## Contingencies
### If players attempt to destroy the ship on the roof
All players take one conflict. An extra prologue encounter will handle escaping through the sewers with Norlove and
finding transport off world.

### If players enter from the roof
Play will progress normally, but players will need to retreat back from where they came. Clone troopers will always
enter through the main entrance.
