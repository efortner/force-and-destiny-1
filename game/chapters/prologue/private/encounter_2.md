# Encounter 2
## Flavor Text

## Location
The players have found themselves in the heart of Norlove's operation. The warehouse is one large, open room with
crates forming aisles. A few noncombatants are sifting through the shelves, but will retreat when seeing players.

## Events
1. Players spot Norlove, prompting a chase. He initially weaves through aisles trying lose the players, but will
eventually run through an open blast door. Fumbling, he will be unable to get the door latched and will continue
upstairs. During the players' chase, blaster fire erupts behind them,
and they see the [ARC troopers](../../../characters/npcs/arc_troopers.md)
shooting at them.
2. [TODO] will hold off 11/12 of the ARC troopers and yell for the players to run after Norlove, one ARC trooper will
make it through the door before it closes, prompting a fight.

## Loot
Players can find a nearly limitless supply of blaster pistols and reloads. Take 1 conflict per blaster pistol looted.

## Contingencies
### If the players don't close the door
[TODO] will use Force Move to hit the blast door controls.

### If the players don't go through the blast door
