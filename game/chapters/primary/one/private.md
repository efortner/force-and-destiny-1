# Chapter One
## Synopsis
A PC starts receiving Force visions calling him to the [Silver Forest](../../../locations/silver_forest.md). Once there,
the party must pass a challenge and then ultimately find a Sith holocron created by self-styled "Sith Master" Darth
Vidi left for his unnamed apprentice. The holocron contains knowledge of the "bind" Force power as well as the existence
of a star system hidden by the Force.

## Movements
### Preparation in [Fezz](../../../locations/fezz.md)
```
You are whisked away through the clouds. You see a forest of enormous trees towering more than a kilometer over the
ground and shrouded in fog. You see a blue lightsaber and a red lightsaber ignite. You see a bright white light and 
sudden inky blackness.
```
The party is aware of the existence of the Silver Forest as well as the [ghost spiders](../../../characters/npcs/ghost_spider.md)
that live there. They may purchase rations, equipment, etc. that they may need. It is about a two-day speeder ride to
the forest. With a perception check, someone in the party will see an Imperial scout probe in the city somewhere.
### Random Encounter
Roll from the [random encounters list](../../../misc/random_events.md).
### Entering the Forest
```
The trees tower far above you, but you cannot see their tops. Visibility is low (about 100 meters) as a thick fog engulfs
the trees. You see what must be leaves scattered around. Each leaf is about 20 meters wide. You see huge spiderwebs
spun between some of the leaves.
```
Players encounter periodic ghost spiders as they search for the source of the Force within the forest.
### The Holocron
```
You break into a clearing where the fog lifts somewhat. You believe you are in the very center of the forest. There
are no spider webs here. There are roughly two dozen rusted out old houses and buildings scattered around the clearing.
Overgrown roads connect the buildings. You realize quickly that this was a highly planned community. Streets run parallel,
and buildings are highly uniform. There is a clear center of the village with a building that rises slightly higher than
the rest. All buildings are completely overgrown with moss and creeping vines.
```
Inside the center building, the players feel a strong Dark presence. They are ambushed by dark clones of themselves
(stat block Fallen Apprentice, p. 412). These Force clones deal all damage as strain but take wounds and strain as normal.
They dissolve on death or unconscious. Once all are defeated, the [holocron](../../../gear/vidi_holocron.md) will manifest.
Obtaining the holocron triggers a disturbance in the Force, which is felt by the Inquisitorius.
