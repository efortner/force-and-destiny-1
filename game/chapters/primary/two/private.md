# Chapter Two
## Synopsis
Ten hours after obtaining the [Sith Holocron](../../../gear/vidi_holocron.md), an Imperial Star Destroyer will enter
the atmosphere (arriving from nearby Formos). Landing craft will deploy stormtroopers that will begin killing citizens
of [Fezz](../../../locations/fezz.md) until the players show themselves. Players will accumulate conflict everytime
they ignore a citizen in danger. After two encounters (and if players reveal themselves), a Lambda class shuttle will
descend on the players' position, and an IG-100 Magnaguard (p. 409) will emerge.

## Movements
### Return from the Forest
Players must navigate out of the forest. This is done by rolling 3 successive normal survival checks. Players with
knowledge of the forest may add a boost die. Failures will result in encounters with [ghost spiders](../../../characters/npcs/ghost_spider.md).

### Random Encounter
Roll from the [random encounters list](../../../misc/random_events.md).

### Imperial Invasion
The players see an Imperial Star Destroyer enter the atmosphere and send down landing craft to the surface. It appears
that they are targeting the city of Fezz. As they get close to Fezz, they will hear blaster fire. Encounters with
Imperial troops play out as follows:
* 1d6 citizens are being harassed by 3d6 Imperial stormtroopers (p. 407).
* Players gain 1 conflict for each citizen involved if they choose not to intervene.
* After two groups have been defeated by the players, a Lambda class shuttle will be dispatched to their location.

### The Magnaguard
A magnaguard (p. 409) emerges from the shuttle with weapon drawn (1 TIE Pilot, p. 408 remains inside for the duration).
If players flee, the magnaguard will attempt to accost nearby citizens to draw the players out. Once the droid is
defeated, the [shuttle](../../../vessels/lambda_shuttle.md) can be easily hijacked.

## Rewards
* (On the shuttle) 700 credits
* Inquisitorious dispatch note: `On my way. Make sure they survive.`
