### Synopsis
The players arrive looking for contract work from [Lantillies Corp](../../../organizations/lantillies_corp.md). Lantillies
will ask the players to investigate an Imperially-escorted survey crew investigating a purported major gold vein on the planet.
This gold mine will increase efficiency and profitability for Lantillies. On exit, [Marva Loes](../../../characters/npcs/marva_loes.md)
will try to pursuade the characters to instead ensure that no survivors are found.

### Encounter 1
* 2 Gundarks (A&A p. 120)

### Encounter 2
* 1 Rancor (A&A p. 134)
* Players can choose to sneak around, there's a cave entrance it can't fit in behind.

### Encounter 3
* [Cpt. Donner](../../../characters/npcs/mercutio_donner.md), a Darwinistic captain who has survived by eating the remains of his party.

### Bonus Encounter
* While exploring the cave, the players will have the option to investigate a tangent that calls to them through the Force.
* Following the path will take them to a door that they can open using the Force.
* Inside, they find a small room containing a Force projection of [the Inquisitor Taas](../../../characters/npcs/taas.md).
* Taas will appear unarmed in meditation and will taunt the players.
* The body of [Tardus Milobo](../../../characters) will be hanging, apparently unconscious, in the room, his clothes singed (also Force illusion).
* Taas claims she found him like this. He moans deliriously to make her stop.
* If the players attack her, she will summon a lightsaber from nothing and defend herself.
* She will latch onto Wolf and tell him to feel the anger building inside him.
* If the players attempt to physically subdue Taas, she will mysteriously vanish and reappear outside their grasp.
* If the players attack her, she will deal strain damage.
* By emptying themselves of emotion, they can earn passage into the inner sanctum, the final resting place for three Jedi.
* A worn inscription from the Jedi offers their "tools of defense" to a future generation in their time of need.
* Extra Rewards: 3 lightsabers (currently nonfunctional, but complete with Ilum crystals, players' choice of colors).
