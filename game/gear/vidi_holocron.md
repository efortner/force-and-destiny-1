# Sith Holocron of Darth Vidi

## Description
A Sith holocron containing the knowledge of Darth Vidi. It was intended as a gift for his apprentice.
This holocron can use either Light or Dark side pips, but each pip costs a conflict. The holocron can be opened by one character one time
every session. If a character fails their check to open the holocron, another character may attempt to open the
holocron this session. Every attempt, regardless of result, costs 1 conflict.

Greetings, apprentice. I trust then that you have completed your mission on Rendili to retrieve the 
coordinates. I will contact you in person once I have worked out a viable hyperspace lane
to Jal Shey. In the meantime, I give you the gift of knowledge. You find yourself in the remnants of a
small Jal Shey community. More importantly, you are inside the famous Silver Forest of Dreams, which
was created in its entirety by the Jal Shey. The Force shrowds the village, making it impossible to
find without the assistence of the Force. The mythical Jal Shey homeworld is rumored to have expanded
this to the scale of an entire star system. Every citizen breathed in the Force from birth and hidden
from the eyes of the unworthy. Yet Jal Shey is stable in nature, unlike the tempestuous Tython. There we 
will rebuild the Sith, not as a petty duo locked in a struggle for power, but once again as a true empire.
This holocron will help you continue your training as well as help fund your endevours.
