See p. 260

## Description
Stolen from an Imperial Magnaguard, this unglamorous shuttle has been kept in tip top shape by the Imperial navy.
Stenciled onto the port side of cockpit on the exterior is the ship's name. The shuttle sends a ping containing its
location to its carrier every time it enters or exits hyperspace. Roll a computers difficulty 3 check each time 
to prevent the craft from sending the ping. This can be permanently disabled by a mechanic at a properly
equipped space port. The shuttle will casually appear friendly to Imperial forces, but with any scrutiny, they will
realize that this vessel is stolen.
